# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello and Welcome, My name is Oluwaferanmi Adedokun, for the most part of my life for now, I'm a Frontend Developer(not yet Engineer). Working on my progress on building anything around the web with Javascript(Backend and Mobile) to become a Fullstack Engineer.

## Thoughts (ðŸ’­) and Work Lately (ðŸ’»)

Aside from constants thoughts on building and launching the next super cool product for Africa and scaling it, I am constantly building myself up to be a freelance & Full time Frontend developer(if there's any gig), working on the first iteration of my Portfolio, making constant commits to both rockrt.css and my shorten links App and steadily making sure to make "A commit a day  ðŸ’†"

## Learning and Progress
