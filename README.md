Hello and Welcome, My name is Oluwaferanmi Adedokun, for the most part of my life for now, I'm a Frontend Developer(not yet Engineer). Working on my progress on building anything around the web with Javascript(Backend and Mobile) to become a Fullstack Engineer.

## Thoughts and work Lately
Aside from constants thoughts on building and launching the next super cool product for Africa and scale with, I am constantly building myself up to be a freelance & Full time Frontend developer(if there's any gig), working on the first iteration of my Portfolio, making constant commits to both rockrt.css and my shorten links App
