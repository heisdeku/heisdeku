# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello and Welcome, My name is Oluwaferanmi Adedokun, for the most part of my life for now, I'm a Frontend Developer(not yet Engineer). Working on my progress on building anything around the web with Javascript(Backend and Mobile) to become a Fullstack Engineer.

## <u>Brief Intro</u>

Aside from constants thoughts on building and launching the next super cool product for Africa and scaling it, I am constantly building myself up to be a pixel obsessed Frontend developer, working on the first iteration of my Portfolio, making constant commits to a dope new savings company and steadily making sure to make <b style="font-size: 18px;"><i>"A commit a day  ðŸ’†"</i></b>

## <u>Learning and Progress</u>

Recently i have decided to take React Native by the horns and devote a lot of my time into the mastery of CSS, Javascript DS and Next Js
